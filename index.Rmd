# About

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website that features a series of mathematical problems that can be solved with the help of computer programs. To solve a given problem one can usually come up with a brute-force algorithm. But depending on your computer these "simple" algorithms can take quite some time to find the right answer. The challenge is to write programs that can find the correct answers quickly, i.e. in a matter of seconds on computers for personal use. 

In blogs and forums one can find many such programs written in C, C#, C++, Java, and Python. Programs written in R are far less common, which is why I'm writing this book. I hope to come up with good R programs for as many of the Project Euler problems as possible.
